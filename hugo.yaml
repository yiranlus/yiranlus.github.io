      I am PhD in Nanophysics. I study electron ptychography, and I study the physics, the mathematics and the algorithms behind it. I have strong interest in computer science, especially the artificial intelligence in recent years. I am taking a training course in Data Science and it will finish soon.

      I am currently searching for a job as data scientist, software engineer, or research engineer.
